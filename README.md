# ToDo

- Allow usage of TS path alias `~`
- Write `README.md` & `CHANGELOG.md`
- Create git project
- Do we need `components.json`?
- Check if we need to run `npm i` or anything the like in consuming code after `npm run dev:unlink-halumi-ui`

# Things to mention in readme

- Fonts & font defintion in tailwind.config is provided by consumer
- How to work during dev (use increasing alpha versions whenever making a change, install in consumer, maybe about linking, when to re-start next server, etc.)
